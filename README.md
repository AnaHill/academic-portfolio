<!-- ### Part-Time Postdoctoral Researcher ### -->
## Visiting Scholar @ Tampere University (_Nov 2022 - Dec 2024_)
I continued to work as a part-time (approx. 10 hours/month) researcher with Professor Pasi Kallio, finishing following publications. 

### Yrjänäinen et al. (2024) _Barrier-free, open-top microfluidic chip for generating two distinct, interconnected 3D microvascular networks_ [link](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-74493-3 "doi: 10.1038/s41598-024-74493-3") (<span style="color:black">**last author**</span>)

> 🚀 *Bringing the future of tissue engineering one step closer!*  
I lead a **multidisciplinary research team** that has developed a groundbreaking **"body-on-chip" platform** for studying vascularized **3D cell co-cultures**. Our team introduced an **innovative open-top microfluidic chip** that enables the cultivation of **two distinct 3D cell cultures** within a single device—**without physical barriers**. This breakthrough technology opens new possibilities for **studying cell-cell interactions** in a precisely controlled microenvironment and advancing **drug testing** applications.  

### Mäki et al. (2024) _Simulation-Based Study of Control Strategies for Beating of Human Cardiomyocyte Cultures_ [link](https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2023.3309668)  

> I developed a fuzzy controller and a mathematical model to simulate and control temperature-dependency of beating human cardiomyocyte cultures. This research offers valuable guidance for scientists aiming to standardize experimental conditions and improve the reliability of cardiomyocyte-based assays.

### Mäki et al. (2023) _Opinion: The correct way to analyze FP signals_ [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10205591.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10205591)

> In November 2023, I published a comprehensive report titled **"Opinion: The correct way to analyze FP signals"**. This work encapsulates my extensive experience in analyzing **field potential (FP) signals** derived from **2D human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) cultures**.

> While developing the **DatAnalyzer** software ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AnaHill/DatAnalyzer?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), I observed a wide array of methodologies used for FP signal analysis across various studies. This inconsistency often led to confusion, highlighting the need for a **cohesive analytical framework**.  
> 
> Driven by this realization, I dedicated significant effort to produce an academically rigorous report that—despite not undergoing formal peer review process—offers valuable **insights and guidance** for researchers navigating the complexities of FP signal analysis.

<!-- ### Postdoc ### -->
## Postdoctoral Research Fellow @ Tampere University (_Sep 2018 - Nov 2022_)
My research focused on **microsystems**, **microfluidics**, **control engineering**, **data analysis** with MATLAB.
My main tools were **MATLAB**, **Simulink**, **COMSOL (FEM)**, and **soft lithography (PDMS)**.

I worked as a postdoc in professor Pasi Kallio's team [1, 2](), where I developed data engineering and analysis solutions to automatize data analysis of several challenging biosignals and data types (e.g. HDF5, .csv, image, and video). My work involved GUI development and implementation of machine learning solutions in MATLAB environment. [3-8]()

Additionally, I worked as professor Kallio’s Vice-PI in a multidisciplinary CoEBoC team [2]() combining cell biologists and engineers, and led a group of researchers developing a novel "body-on-chip" platform for vascularized 3D cell co-cultures studies [11]().

## DatAnalyzer: The correct way to analyze FP signals
Tools to load, visualize, and analyse data using MATLAB.
- [DatAnalyzer home page](https://github.com/AnaHill/DatAnalyzer)  
- Publication _Opinion: The correct way to analyze FP signals_ available in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10205591)

Tools and keywords: **MATLAB**, **data analysis**, **MEA**, **hiPS-CM**

Developed method and tool (DatAnalyzer) to analyze field potential (FP) signals from 2D human induced pluripotent stem cells derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) cultures. I summarized how FP signals have been analyzed various, sometimes even contradictory, ways in the literature, and proposed my own methdod that could be considered.

## Write LaTeX documents together with co-authors that use MS Word
Project [page](https://github.com/AnaHill/Write-LaTeX-documents-using-Word) explains how to use this tool

Tools: **Powershell**, **Pandoc**, **LaTeX**, **Markdown**

Do you want to use LaTeX for you (scientific) paper, but struggling when co-authors, such as you supervisor, do not use it, and therefore Word is preferred? This is tool for you! Minimize hasszle of exporting files in different formats and copy-paste text from one format to another, while still be able to write LaTeX-documents and publish high-quality papers.

For example, this paper freely available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10242335) was written using this tool.
