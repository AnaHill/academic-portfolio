<!-- ### Postdoc ### -->
## Postdoctoral Research Fellow @ Tampere University (_Sep 2018 - Nov 2022_)
My research focused on **microsystems**, **microfluidics**, **control engineering**, **data analysis** with MATLAB.
My main tools were **MATLAB**, **Simulink**, **COMSOL (FEM)**, and **soft lithography (PDMS)**.

I worked as a postdoc in professor Pasi Kallio's team [1, 2](), where I developed data engineering and analysis solutions to automatize data analysis of several challenging biosignals and data types (e.g. HDF5, .csv, image, and video). My work involved GUI development and implementation of machine learning solutions in MATLAB environment. [3-8]()

Additionally, I worked as professor Kallio‚Äôs Vice-PI in a multidisciplinary CoEBoC team [2]() combining cell biologists and engineers, and led a group of researchers developing a novel "body-on-chip" platform for vascularized 3D cell co-cultures studies [11]().

## DatAnalyzer: The correct way to analyze FP signals
Tools to load, visualize, and analyse data using MATLAB.
- [DatAnalyzer home page](https://github.com/AnaHill/DatAnalyzer)  
- Publication _Opinion: The correct way to analyze FP signals_ available in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10205591)

Tools and keywords: **MATLAB**, **data analysis**, **MEA**, **hiPS-CM**

Developed method and tool (DatAnalyzer) to analyze field potential (FP) signals from 2D human induced pluripotent stem cells derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) cultures. I summarized how FP signals have been analyzed various, sometimes even contradictory, ways in the literature, and proposed my own methdod that could be considered.

![DatAnalyzer in action](/pics/DatAnalyzer.png)

## Write LaTeX documents together with co-authors that use MS Word
Project [page](https://github.com/AnaHill/Write-LaTeX-documents-using-Word) explains how to use this tool

Tools: **Powershell**, **Pandoc**, **LaTeX**, **Markdown**

Do you want to use LaTeX for you (scientific) paper, but struggling when co-authors, such as you supervisor, do not use it, and therefore Word is preferred? This is tool for you! Minimize hasszle of exporting files in different formats and copy-paste text from one format to another, while still be able to write LaTeX-documents and publish high-quality papers.

For example, this paper freely available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10242335) was written using this tool.
